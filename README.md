# Home Assistant Flatlib Astrology API

A powerful Home Assistant Add-on providing a local **FastAPI** backend for advanced astrological calculations using [Flatlib](https://github.com/flatangle/flatlib) and [Swiss Ephemeris](https://www.astro.com/swisseph/).

-----

## ‚ú® Overview

This add-on runs a high-performance **FastAPI server** directly within your Home Assistant environment. It serves as a robust backend for complex astrological computations, offering a reliable and fast API. By performing all calculations locally, it ensures your sensitive personal data remains private and secure.

The add-on is designed to support a wide range of use cases, from simple automations to feeding structured data to Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic, personalized interpretations.

## üöÄ Key Features (v0.2.0)

  - **Backend Migration to FastAPI**: The server has been completely rewritten from Flask to FastAPI, offering significantly improved performance, asynchronous support, and modern API documentation.
  - **Natal Chart Calculation**: Get a complete natal chart, including planets, lunar nodes, Lilith (Syzygy), Pars Fortuna, Ascendant, Midheaven, and house cusps.
  - **Daily, Monthly, & Yearly Horoscopes**: New API endpoints to calculate **transits** and **predictions** for specific dates, months, or years.
  - **Synastry Calculation**: An all-new endpoint to calculate compatibility between two natal charts.
  - **LLM Integration Ready**: Designed to provide structured astrological data (JSON) directly to LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, Ollama) for personalized interpretations.
  - **Local & Private**: All computations are performed locally on your Home Assistant server, ensuring sensitive birth data never leaves your network.
