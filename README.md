# Home Assistant Flatlib Astrology Add-on

A lightweight Home Assistant Add-on providing a local Flask-based REST API for calculating **astrological natal charts and transits** using [Flatlib](https://github.com/flatangle/flatlib) and [Swiss Ephemeris](https://www.astro.com/swisseph/).

---

## üåü Overview

This add-on spins up a local Flask server within your Home Assistant environment. It acts as a backend for complex astrological computations, offering a reliable API for various Home Assistant automations, integrations with Large Language Models (LLMs), or other external astrology tools. By keeping the computations local, it ensures privacy and faster response times.

---

## üîÆ Features

-   **Natal Chart Calculation:** Get precise positions of classical planets, lunar nodes, Lilith (Syzygy), Pars Fortuna, Ascendant, Midheaven, and house cusps based on birth data.
-   **Natal Aspects:** Calculate aspects between planets in the natal chart.
-   **Transit Chart Calculation:** Determine current planetary positions for any given date and time.
-   **Transit Aspects:** Compute interactive aspects between transit planets and natal chart positions, crucial for daily, monthly, or yearly forecasts.
-   **LLM Integration Ready:** Designed to provide structured astrological data (JSON) directly to LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, Ollama) for dynamic, personalized interpretations and guidance.
-   **Seamless Home Assistant Integration:** Easily used within Home Assistant automations, templates, and custom components.
-   **Local & Private:** All computations are performed locally on your Home Assistant server, ensuring your sensitive birth data remains private.
-   **Lightweight & Dockerized:** Built for efficiency and easy deployment within the Home Assistant Add-on ecosystem.

## üöÄ Installation

To install this add-on in your Home Assistant instance:

1.  **Add the Add-on Repository:**
    * Click the button below to directly add this repository to your Home Assistant Add-on Store:

        [![Add Repository to Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/add_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/add_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/navi-vonamut/Flatlib-Natal-Chart-API)


    * Alternatively, you can manually add the repository:
        * In Home Assistant, navigate to **Settings** > **Add-ons** > **Add-on Store**.
        * Click the three dots in the top right corner and select **"Repositories"**.
        * Enter the URL of this GitHub repository:
            `https://github.com/navi-vonamut/Flatlib-Natal-Chart-AP`
        * Click "Add", then "Close".
2.  **Install the Add-on:**
    * Refresh the Add-on Store page (you might need to refresh your browser).
    * You should now see a new add-on named "**Flatlib Natal Chart API**". Click on it.
    * Click the **"Install"** button.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

After installation, go to the **"Configuration"** tab of the add-on.

* **`log_level` (Logging Level):** Adjust the verbosity of the add-on's logs. Recommended: `info` for normal operation, `debug` for troubleshooting.

---

## üí° API Usage

The add-on runs a Flask server, accessible within the Home Assistant Docker network at `http://a0d7b954-flatlib-server:8080`. From outside the Home Assistant host, you'll need to configure port forwarding in the add-on settings (default: 8080/tcp).

### Endpoints:

      "lon": LONGITUDE      
    }
    ```
    * `date`: Birth date (e.g., "1990-05-03").

    * `tz`: Timezone offset from UTC (e.g., "+03:00").
    * `lat`: Birth latitude (e.g., 56.2576).
    * `lon`: Birth longitude (e.g., 43.9827).

* **Example Response (JSON - truncated for brevity):**
    ```json
    {
      "planets": {
        "SUN": { "id": "SUN", "sign": "Taurus", "sign_pos": 12.73, "lon": 42.7302, ... },
